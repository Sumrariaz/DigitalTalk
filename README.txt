# CodeTest

Formatting

1.The code follows a consistent indentation style, which makes it easier to read and understand.
2.Variable names are generally descriptive and meaningful that improving code readability.
3.The code makes use of Laravel's Eloquent ORM methods like findOrFail() and relationships like user(), which can simplify database operations and enhance code maintainability.


What makes it amazing code.

1.Using proper naming convention
2.The code could benefit from better error handling. For example in getUsersJobs(), if $cuser is not found, the function could return an appropriate response.
3.Replaced DB::table() queries with Eloquent models for better readability.
4.Removed conditions that is duplicated.
5.Removed the commented-out code if it is not needed.
6.Changed the comparison operator to ensure strict comparison.


improvements:

1.The code could benefit from better error handling. For example in getUsersJobs(), if $cuser is not found, the function could return an appropriate response.
2.Variable names have been updated to use camelCase for improved readability.
3.Replaced DB::table() queries with Eloquent models for better readability.
4.Used the pluck() method to retrieve a specific column instead of lists(), which is deprecated in Laravel.
5.Replaced the orderBy() function calls after the paginate() method instead of before.
6.Removed conditions that were duplicated in the query builder.
7.Removed the commented-out code as it is not needed.
8.Replaced the check for an empty ($data['admin_comments'] == '') with empty($data['admin_comments']) for better readability and to handle different cases (e.g., whitespace-only).
9.Removed the return false statement at the end of the function changeCompletedStatus() since it will not be reached.
10.Simplified the if-else conditions
11.Changed the comparison operator like != to !== to ensure strict comparison of status values.
12.Extracted the switch statement logic into a separate helper method called handleStatusChange. This makes the changeStatus function more focused.
13.The loop has been modified to collect valid job IDs in a separate array instead of using unset. This ensures that the resulting array maintains sequential keys without any gaps.
14.In getUsersJobsHistory() variable $noramlJobs is assigned the same value as $jobs_ids, which might be unnecessary duplication. It should be evaluated if $noramlJobs serves any purpose or if it can be removed
15.It's unclear why the $emergencyJobs array is always empty in the returned results. If there is no need for it, it should be removed.
16.The line $pagenum = isset($page) ? $page : "1"; can be simplified using the null coalescing operator: $pagenum = $page ?? "1";
17.The jobEnd() function initializes a new instance of AppMailer multiple times for sending emails. It would be better to have a single instance of the mailer and reuse it throughout the function.
18.Updated the array syntax to use square brackets for better readability.
19.Replaced Carbon::now() with date('Y-m-d H:i:s') in a few places for consistency.
20.Used the object syntax ($affectedRows->id) to retrieve the ID after creating a new Job record instead of accessing the array index in reopen().
21.Removed unnecessary parentheses around the subject string in sendChangedTranslatorNotification().






*Booking Controller*

1.No validation checks in any function of controller
2.Error and success responses are not handled 
3.Try catch used in resendSMSNotifications() but catch through "success" instead of error
4.No need to send $request->__authenticatedUser in $this->repository->store($request->__authenticatedUser, $data) as $data has all requests
5.Use strict operators == or === in if($user_id = $request->get('user_id'))
6.remove unnecessary initialized variables which are or used in function

Improvement

1.Use proper Laravel validations
2.Better to create BaseController which handles success and error responses and extend it in BookingController
